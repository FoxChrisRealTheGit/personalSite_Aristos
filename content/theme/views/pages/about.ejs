            <h4>developer</h4>
            <p> I am a very motivated, self-taught web developer with knowledge of Golang, ReactJs, Javascript, HTML, CSS, RESTful
                api's, Express, and NodeJS. Currently, I am exploring various computer science topics and data structure
                solutions. Kali Linux also has my interest.</p>

            <h4>designer</h4>
            <p>I will have my BA for Graphic Design in October 2018. I have played around with the creation of various print
                material, but I am very interested in the UX considerations surrounding web design. VR is also extremely
                fascinating to me at the present moment.</p>

            <h4>writer</h4>
            <p>I regularly perform spoken word poetry and try to tell stories when I can. I enjoy being in front of people and
                working with crowds. I have well over 200 pages of various scripts, a few plays being worked on, a completed
                novel, and a collection of short stories near completion.</p>
